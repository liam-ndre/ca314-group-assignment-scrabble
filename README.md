<span style="text-decoration:underline;">1. Summary of changes and additions since the presentation.</span>

We have added/changed the following things:

* Changed the design and UI of the start and game page.
* We have implemented a multiplayer feature where player 1 can connect to player 2's game using player’s 2 host IP.
* **The game requires tkinter to enable the GUI.**
* **The game also requires PIL to enable the GUI**

**Issues:**



* The pass button does not work, has something to do with the player.py (Ttinker error)
* The Join Game(Auto) takes a very long time to work
